# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Commands
In this challenge, you will invoke your first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:

hacker@dojo:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@dojo:~$
Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.

In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.

### Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{QrDyyOoxB12bYvDOO06TuSVaPtw.QX3YjM1wCM5AzNzEzW'

I just typed hello and pressed enter.

### New Learnings
I learned to type and hello and display it on the screen in the terminal
