# Hello Hackers

##  Command History
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. 
This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! 
In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!


### Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{Mg19BpqrLNq7H4KLBR-LXH-v7U8.0lNzEzNxwCM5AzNzEzW}'

In this challenge, I just opened a terminal and hit the up arrow as intended by the challenge to get the Flag. Then I just copied it to the clipboard and pasted it in the website to complete the challenge.

### New Learnings
I learnt that the most used commands / previous used commands are saved in the istory of the terminal for using them afterwards.
