# Digesting Documentation

## Helpful Programs
Some programs don't have a man page, but might tell you how to run them if invoked with a special argument. 
Usually, this argument is --help, but it can often be -h or, in rare cases, -?, help, or other esoteric values like /? (though that latter is more frequently encountered on Windows).

In this level, you will practice reading a program's documentation with --help. Try it out!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{clVzMKTuN0_PAJfZsLKOKhEGjgb.QX3IDO0wCM5AzNzEzW}`
I used the '/challenge/challenge --help' command to view the usage of '/challenge/challenge' command
and got to know the two commands to get the secret value for using '/challenge/challenge -g' command
and '/challenge/challenge -g' command with the secret value as an argument to '-g' to get the flag.

### New Learnings
I learnt how to make the program tell me the usage of certain commands and how to reach the appropriate result
