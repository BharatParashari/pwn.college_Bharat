# Digesting Documentation

## Searching Manuals
You can scroll man pages with the arrow keys (and PgUp/PgDn) and search with /. 
After searching, you can hit n to go to the next result and N to go to the previous result. Instead of /, you can use ? to search backwards!

Find the option that will give you the flag by reading the challenge man page.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UzMvrJzy5N78KYq-wJ4UGwH2jDT.QX1EDO0wCM5AzNzEzW}`
I searched the manual of '/challenge/challenge' for the right command to get the flag and passed it as and argument.

### New Learnings
I learned how to search the manual using '/, n, N, q, ?' etc.
