## Tab completion on commands
Tab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

NOTE: You can auto-complete any command, but be careful: callous auto-completes without double-checking the result can wreak havoc in your shell if you accidentally run the wrong commands!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EEeZlG91fwyIRznMw7rNwuzeErD.0VN0EzNxwCM5AzNzEzW}`
