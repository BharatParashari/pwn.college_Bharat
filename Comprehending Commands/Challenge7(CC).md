# Comprehending Commands

## Touching Files

Of course, you can also create files! There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here. You can create a new, blank file by touching it with the touch command:

hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ touch pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$
It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kkkexa67Bu90rJWUVcVmCRKBaHU.QXwMDO0wCM5AzNzEzW}`
I used the '/tmp' command to create two new files, and then I changed my directory to '/challenge' and ran the "./run" command to get the flag.

### New Learnings
I learnt how to create new files in the directories.
