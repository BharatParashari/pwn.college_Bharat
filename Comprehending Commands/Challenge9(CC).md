# Comprehending Commands

## Moving Files
You can also move files around with the mv command. The usage is simple:

hacker@dojo:~$ ls
my-file
hacker@dojo:~$ cat my-file
PWN!
hacker@dojo:~$ mv my-file your-file
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
your-file
hacker@dojo:~$ cat your-file
PWN!
hacker@dojo:~$
This challenge wants you to move the /flag file into /tmp/hack-the-planet (do it)! When you're done, run /challenge/check, which will check things out and give the flag to you.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EombPj3k3zL1_brMBOAItr-E5me.0VOxEzNxwCM5AzNzEzW}`
I used the "mv" command to move the '/flag' file to '/tmp/hack-the-planet' file
